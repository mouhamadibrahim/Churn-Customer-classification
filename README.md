# Churn-Customer-classification

I used "Telco Customer Churn" data set from kaggle

There are 20 featuures and 1 target variable for 7043 customers.

In this project, I have used machine learning classification algorithms in order to find if the customer is going to learve the company (Churn is true) or whether he is not going to. 

I have used Exploratory data analysis techniques in order to analyse the data that I have. data preprocessing stage in order to fix the data and clean them then creating machine learning models on the processed data. for this project i have used Ridge regression,Random forest for this project which I think would be the best suitable for.
